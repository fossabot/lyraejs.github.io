# Other from of lyrajs

The previous [Getting Started](getting-started) document is for default lyrajs project. If you want to start a lyrajs-pug/lyrajs-preact(not started) based project see below :arrow_down:

``` bash
# Suppose you have alerady installed lyra-cli
lyra init --use-pug <projectName>
# or lyrajs-preact
lyra init --use-preact <projectName>
```

And initialize the project as you are using default lyrajs.

If you want more documentation for lyrajs-pug, see [Pug Document](pug/)
